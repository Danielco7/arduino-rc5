# Arduino Ultrasonic Sensor Project

This repository contains the code and setup for an **Arduino Ultrasonic Sensor** project. The project uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance between the sensor and an object, providing real-time measurements on a display (or serial monitor).

## Overview

In this project, an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** is used with an Arduino to measure the distance between the sensor and an object. The sensor emits ultrasonic sound waves and measures the time it takes for them to bounce back from an object, which is then used to calculate the distance.

The measured distance can be displayed on a **serial monitor** or any other connected display like an LCD.

## Components

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Jumper wires
- [Optional] LCD Display or Serial Monitor for output
- [Optional] Breadboard for easy connections
